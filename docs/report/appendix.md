## Original Project Specification

This project was inspired by the original project specification created by Dr. Josephine Griffith, as follows:
> ### Contrasting sentiment across Political Personalities
> Many modern politicians use Twitter to highlight their opinions and policies and promote themselves and their party. Generally, their party is known to be aligned to a particular ideology (conservative, liberal, socialist, etc.). Different world events might affect the mood of these tweets – from happiness as a result of a sporting event to sadness and empathy as a result of a natural disaster. Much work in sentiment analysis has considered “mood factors” and used sentiment analysis techniques (specifically machine learning techniques) to extract sentiment and mood in online social media. This project will focus on a select number of different politicians and time lines (associated with certain topics or events) and compare and contrast the sentiments and topics discussed on the associated Twitter accounts. For example, Trump and Sanders (or Obama or Clinton); Michel Barnier (@MichelBarnier) and David Davis (@DavidDavisMP);  Leo Varadkar (@campaignforleo) and Mary Lou McDonald (@MaryLouMcDonald).

## Acknowledgements
I would like to thank my supervisor, Dr. Josephine Griffith, who's support, guidance and feedback throughout this entire project has been extremely helpful.

I would also like to thank all the developers who have contributed to the numerous open-source tools I used during this project. Without their efforts, I would never have been able to achieve so much over the last few months.
