# Sentiment Analysis

Sentiment analysis is the process of determining the emotional tone of a piece of text. Its roots can be traced back to the studies on public opinion analysis at the beginning of the 20th century. Computational linguists became involved during the 1990's. The field rapidly grew in popularity with the rise of social media and 'Web 2.0', beginning in 2004. It is currently one of the fastest growing research areas in computer science [1]. Humans tend to only agree about 80% of the time on sentiment classification which demonstrates the difficulty of the problem [2]

It is widely used by large businesses and other organisations to analyse brand image and reveal customer insights. A number of companies specialise in social media sentiment analysis and sell their software as a service (SAAS), including BrandWatch and Hootsuite. These offer various features including sentiment trends per individual topic, demographic analysis, ranking common terms and alerting for sudden changes in sentiment. It has also been applied to try and predict changes in the stock market [3]. It is clearly an area with a high potential financial value, if applied correctly.

Politics is another area that sentiment analysis has been applied to. The Obama administration used sentiment analysis to gauge public opinion, especially among core supporters, to policy announcements during the 2012 US presidential campaign [4]. It has even been used to try and predict the results of elections in advance, although with mixed levels of success [5], [6].

There are two common styles of techniques used for sentiment analysis, lexicon based approaches and machine learning approaches. Lexicon based approaches include methods such a dictionary based approach, where the words are checked against a known dictionary of positive and negative terms, and a corpus based approach, where statistical similarities are calculated between the text and a pre-existing corpus to determine the likelihood of the text being negative or positive. Machine learning approaches tend to involve training a classifier with some labelled data, to generate a model that can be used to classify previously unseen text [7].
