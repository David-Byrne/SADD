# Conclusion

Using a combination of NLP and machine learning techniques, the system described in this report has achieved at least professional human levels of accuracy at sentiment analysis. It is also far faster and cheaper to run than a team of humans doing the same task.

We have applied this system to over 120,000 Tweets regarding the 8th amendment debate and gained a deep insight into the behaviours of both sides. This has provided us with a unique and valuable dataset covering one of the most important referendums in recent Irish history.

It has also successfully been applied to a number of other domains, demonstrating its flexibility. Potential future applications of this system could include analysing other political topics, civil unrest, sports events, brand image and public relations etc.
