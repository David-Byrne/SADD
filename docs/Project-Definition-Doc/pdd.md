# Real-Time Contrasting of Political Sentiment on Twitter

## Project Definition Document

## Project Description
> What we're doing

Ireland is set to hold a controversial referendum in the Summer of 2018 on
whether or not to repeal the 8th amendment. The 8th amendment of the Irish
Constitution acknowledges "the right to life of the unborn, with due regard
to the equal right to life of the mother" [1]. Effectively, this means a ban
on abortion in almost all circumstances. This has been criticised by various
international organisations including the United Nations who describe it as
"violating women's human rights" [2] and Amnesty International who claim it
puts "women's health at great risk" [3].

Many people use Twitter to share their opinions on topical events. This makes
Twitter a valuable source of data for sentiment analysis on current events as
people can see something and Tweet a reaction almost instantly.

This project involves taking the lead up to the 8th amendment referendum
as a case study on sentiment classification in a divisive domain and
displaying real-time sentiment scores for both sides.


## Purpose
> Why we're doing it

Obviously when dealing with a topic as sensitive as abortion, emotions are
high on both sides of the debate. Modern politics relies heavily on social
media to spread awareness and influence undecided voters. Both sides are
expected to campaign heavily all across social media. This should lead to
strong displays of sentiment from both sides of the debate. Twitter is an
ideal case study to measure this sentiment due to its real-time nature and
character limit that enforces conciseness.

Being able to classify sentiment in real-time will hopefully give us great
insight into the nature of the campaign and how it changes over time. We'd
hope to see spikes in either positive or negative sentiment correlating with
important events in the lead up to the referendum. We'd also hope to see
what, if any, differences the two sides have on average sentiment over the
campaign and how it affects them.


## Problem/Oppertunity
> Why it's worth doing as a project
> Maybe merge with above?

Although the vote itself will happen after the final submission is delivered,
the referendum campaign still gives us a great opportunity to analyse
sentiment in real-time for what looks to be one of the most controversial
votes Ireland has had in years.
