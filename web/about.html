                <p>
                    Ireland is set to hold a referendum on whether or not to repeal
                    the 8th amendment of the Irish constitution. This would remove
                    the effective ban on abortion in Ireland. The 2 sides of the
                    debate are those who want to <span class="repeal-text">repeal
                    the 8th</span> amendment (ie 'Pro-Choice') and those who want to
                    <span class="save-text">save the 8th</span> amendment (ie
                    'Pro-Life')
                </p>
            </div>

        <div class="card mt-4  offset-lg-1 col-lg-10">
            <div class="card-body">
                <h4 class="card-title">Mood</h4>
                <p>
                    Mood is a generalisation of the main emotion appearing in a
                    tweet. Positive mood (with 1 being a totally positive
                    score) includes happiness, hope, kindness... Negative mood
                    (with -1 being a totally negative score) includes sadness,
                    despair, anger...
                </p>
                <p>
                    Given abortion is such a divisive topic, it's likely to cause
                    strong outbursts of mood from both ends of the spectrum,
                    and from both sides of the debate.
                </p>
                <p>
                    An example of a tweet with a positive mood could be
                    <span class="tweet">
                        "Loving this article that appeared in the Dungarvan Leader!
                        #savelives #savethe8th"
                    </span>
                </p>
                <p>
                    A tweet with negative mood would be more like
                    <span class="tweet">
                        "Anyone who is pro-abortion needs to go back to primary school
                        and study basic science. You might then be able to put your brain
                        cells together and realize that abortion is the murder of an
                        innocent child.#ProLife #savethe8th"
                    </span>
                </p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="card mt-4 offset-lg-1 col-lg-10">
            <div class="card-body">
                <h4 class="card-title">WordClouds</h4>
                <p>
                    The wordclouds display the words currently most used by each
                    side, relative to the other. This allows us to see what topics
                    are being focused on by each side, and also the different type
                    of language used. As opposed to the mood graph which gives
                    an overview of the entire debate, the wordclouds focus on the
                    current state of the debate and the trending topics.
